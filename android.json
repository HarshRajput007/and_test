    "description":"Do you want to use your MicroSD card as a real memory extension and install apps on it? Then you need to format it as internal memory. Easy enough on most phones, but unfortunately, some manufacturers such as Sony, LG or Samsung, can't do this by default. However, if your smartphone's OS is Android Marshmallow, a command-line prompt will help. Avoid grief from system updates by following the new tips at the beginning of this article.",

    "name":"Your phone could be fooled by fake fingerprints!",
    "date":"Today",
    "description":"Artificial Intelligence researchers have used a neural network to create fake fingerprints - a hacker's dream tool. The research, published at the end of October, explains that the generated prints can replicate more than one in five real fingerprints in a biometric identification system.\n\nFive researchers, led by Philip Bontrager of the New York University School of Engineering, developed what they called 'DeepMasterPrints'. The Guardian reported that the research was presented at a biometrics conference in Los Angeles.\n\nResearch suggests that this technique could lead to the creation of fake fingerprints that could be used for illegal purposes. In fact, if a tool inspired by DeepMasterPrints were to end up in the wrong hands, it could create several fingerprints corresponding to any account of an unsuspecting user. In practice, if a hacker were to penetrate an account system accessible via fingerprint, they would have a good chance to take full control of them.\n\nThe key to the research is the fact that many biometric scanners only read part of the fingerprint and some portions of the fingertips have many things in common with many others. So, when researchers created new prints by inserting a series of real fingerprints into the database, AI used some parts of them to create new ones that have a lot in common.\n\nThe report also explains that at the moment it is unlikely that anyone could use such a technique to penetrate another user's smartphone. A similar configuration would probably not get the same success rate on a smartphone unless it is optimized for that purpose, which would require a lot of decoding work, said Bontrager.\n\nFinally, Bontrager said that the purpose of this research is to inspire companies to step up their security efforts. 'Nowadays it is impossible to verify whether a biometric data comes from a real person,' added the scientist. ",

    "name":"Google's next Wear OS update to improve battery life!",
    "date":"Today",
    "description":"The last big system update was only a few months ago and now Google has announced, kind of on the down-low, another update for the smartwatch operating system Wear OS. The update promises longer endurance thanks to a new Battery Saver Mode, among other changes.\n\nLet's be honest, a good smartwatch depends on the battery life and a really smart battery management. No one wants to have their high-tech watch permanently in a charging cradle. The next system update for Wear OS, which will simply be called System Version H, will improve battery life and power management.\n\nSo that the wearer of a smartwatch with Google's Wear OS has to charge the watch less frequently, Wear OS System Version H will first receive a new battery saving mode. If the battery level falls below 10 percent, the new energy-saving mode is activated and the smartwatch then becomes only a wristwatch. This feature is currently only available at smartwatches with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 3100, such as the Montblanc Summit 2.\n\nAs a second measure to increase the battery life, Wear OS should go into a deep sleep mode after 30 minutes of inactivity. This should help to ensure that the smartwatch saves juice when not in use.\n\nIn addition to the two measures to increase the battery life, two comfort functions will also be added with Wear OS System Version H. As is already the case with smartphones, in the future wearers of a smartwatch with Wear OS will be able to decide whether the watch should really be switched off or whether a restart should be carried out. In addition, Smart App Resume is intended to simplify the use of smartwatches, since in future apps will pick up where they last left off.\n\nBut there is a drop of bitterness for the Wear OS fans. Google will distribute the update to System Version H of Wear OS in waves over the next few months. A list of the smartwatches which should receive the update is currently not available either. So if you have a smartwatch with Wear OS, then check for updates consciously in the next weeks.",
